## Bitsnap Integrations

OpenSource Bitsnap integrations.

Bitsnap builds API integrations a little differently.
Rather than using standard API specifications, we generate them by reading the official documentation.
This helps us create more reliable integrations because the docs are often the most current source of truth.
